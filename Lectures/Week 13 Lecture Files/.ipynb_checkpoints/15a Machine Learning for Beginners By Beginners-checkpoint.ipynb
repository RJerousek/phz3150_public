    "The history of neural networks traces back to 1943 when neurophysiologist Warren McCulloch and mathematician Walter Pitts portrayed a model of a human brain neuron with a simple electronic circuit which took a set of inputs, multiplied them by weighted values and put them through a threshold gate which gave as output a value of 0 or 1, based on the threshold value. This model was called the McCulloch-Pitts perceptron.\n",

    "This idea was taken further by a psychologist called Rosenblatt who created the mathematical model of the perceptron and called it Mark I Perceptron. It was based on the McCulloch-Pitts model and was one of the first attempts to make a machine learn. The perceptron model also took a set of binary inputs which were then multiplied by weighted values(representing the synapse strength). Then a bias typically having a value of 1 was added(an offset that ensures that more functions are computable with the same input) and once again the output was set to 0 or 1 based on a threshold value. The input mentioned above is either the input data or other perceptrons’ outputs.\n",

    "While the McCulloch-Pitts model was a groundbreaking research at that time, it lacked a good mechanism of learning which made it unsuitable for the area of AI.\n",

    "\n",
    "The main problem with using FC layers for image recognition tasks is that it uses each pixel as a separate feature, which doesn’t seem quite right, given the fact that neural networks are aiming at replicating the human brain. And what helps our brain identify visual input is not just random points, but patterns of points instead. Here’s where processes called convolution and correlation come in handy.\n",
    "### Convolution and Correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolution and correlation in image processing are almost identical processes having one small difference in their implementation. Both of them take an image I, produce a matrix O based on another matrix (called filter or feature map) F. Here is what I mean\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s start with correlation:\n",
    "<img src = \"correlate_matrix.webp\" width = 650 height = 350 />\n",

    "Let’s explain what is happening. The filter is acting like a sliding window which goes through the array, step by step, sliding right until it reaches the end of the row. Then it slides down and starts at the beginning of the row. At each position we sum the dot product of the filter F and the respective window of the input image I. Each position represents a cell in the output O.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Now what about convolution?\n",
    "\n",
    "The only difference between correlation and convolution is that convolution works with the same filter F, only rotated 180 degrees.\n",

    "### But how does that helps us?\n",
    "\n",
    "By using this sort of filters, going through our image we extract not only one pixel, but a whole sector of pixels, enabling our model to map more complex image features like lines and shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you give a convolution layer a cat image it will be able to recognize small features like nose and ears. Then by adding more convolution layers after that it may recognize features of a larger scale like a head or a tail.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way this works is having several filters per convolution layer, all initialized with random numbers. The goal behind this is to have each filter activate on different features(one features trains to detect the nose, other the eyes, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually when dealing with multi-channel images(like RGB) your filters will be 3-dimensional and will have the depth equal to the image channels count. That way you only focus on the 2D process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Padding and Stride\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with convolution and correlation is that the corner pixels don’t get much attention — they only get processed once. If you want to change that, you can add a padding.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"padding.webp\" width = 350 height = 350 />\n",
    "\n",
    "Now even the corners will be processed as much as the other parts of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, however we don’t want to pay as much attention to each pixel(highly applicable when dealing with larger images). Having each filter go through every possible position is sometimes an overkill. That’s why we can configure a stride.\n",
    "\n",
    "The stride tells our filter how much it should slide when going to its next position. Having a stride of 2 will skip one position with each shift which reduces the size of the output and makes computation lighter.\n",

The reason this helps is Convolution layers’s filters are often bound to an exact position in the image. Having a small movement or distortion may result in a different output which is not desirable. Down-sampled images still contain the larger structural features, only excluding fine details that may hinder the model’s performance.\n",
